## 0.3.0 - 2021-06-04

### Changed

      about how to store the stream position

### Added

- Blanket configuration of the `:catch_up_chunk_size` can be set with the

## 0.2.1 - 2021-06-03

### Fixed

- Increased timeout in call to subscibe in InOrder subscriber

### Added

- Added a configuration parameter for the InOrder subscription which controls
  the batch size of events read while catching up: `:catch_up_chunk_size`

## 0.2.0 - 2021-06-01

      service such as LaunchDarkly
